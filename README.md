**Deep Learning for Skin Lesion Classification**

This project leverages **deep learning** to classify skin lesions, aiding in **early melanoma detection**. Using **ResNet-50**, the model distinguishes between multiple skin lesion types with **high accuracy**. 

### **Key Highlights:**
- **Dataset:** HAM10000 & BCN20000 (dermoscopic images + metadata).
- **Preprocessing:** Hair removal, contrast adjustment, data augmentation.
- **Model:** Modified **ResNet-50** with metadata integration.
- **Training:** PyTorch, Adam optimizer, batch size = 32, learning rate = 0.001.
- **Evaluation:** Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, F1-score.
- **Challenges:** Addressed class imbalance & overfitting with augmentation & dropout.
- **Future Work:** Transfer learning, explainable AI, and multimodal learning.

This project demonstrates the potential of **AI in dermatology**, showcasing **automated skin cancer detection** using CNNs and metadata-driven insights.
